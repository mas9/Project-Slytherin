	A Wheaton College Class of 2018 member, Quinn is an Art History major.  Her interest in Art History stemmed from a love of the Classics and Classical Literature.  At Wheaton she works in the Permanent Collection as a collection assistent, giving her access to both the school's art and the skills of collection management.  During the summer of 2016, she interned at the Attleboro Arts Museum, a non-profit near Wheaton's campus.  This has allowed her to further immerse herself in the art world outside of Wheaton.  Seeing how the arts can be a central part of a community and young peopleâ€™s lives she knows that art and art history will continue to play a large role in the future.  Both of these opportunities have given Quinn the time to cultivate knowledge of the many facets of the art world and deepen her love for art.  Another part of her hope to help facilitate the love of art and art history is her role on the Executive Board of Wheaton College's Art History Club (ArtHive), as the Social Media Coordinator.  While abroad in the Fall of 2016 Quinn was able to travel and experience some of the art that she has so long held in high regard.  This excitement for both travel and learning will certainly stay with her.  One day Quinn aspires to see the Sagrada Familia in it's hoped completion.
