	Allison is an Art History and European History double major at Wheaton College, en route to graduate in spring 2018. She has always been eager to engage in the arts and has a special place in her heart for "troubled" artist Vincent van Gogh. Her love of art history began in high school with an essay on the Helvetica font and her interests range from medieval Irish manuscripts to contemporary textile art. While at Wheaton, Allison has worked in the Wheaton College Permanent Collection, assisted in research, and served as the President of ARTHive (Wheaton's only art history club). Besides her various work-study jobs at Wheaton, Allison is an interpreter [tour guide] for the Old Slater Mill Association in Pawtucket, RI. Allison recently returned from studying abroad in Cork, Ireland, where she was able to walk through tower houses, stand in the shadows of high crosses, and listen to traditional oral storytelling. Her experience in Ireland has sparked her desire to pursue a Master's degree in either Irish art or Irish folklore. Needless to say, she wants to go back very soon!
