	Audrey Spina will be graduating this May 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and English. She has an insatiable desire to learn and grow, and since her freshman year, she has worked vigorously to build professional experiences in the arts field by interning and volunteering in a variety of art/non-profit/museum departments, including communications, development, education, permanent art collections, and archives. Her past summer internship at the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities in Providence fully immersed her in the Rhode Island community. At the Council, she experienced how the public humanities support, strengthen, and seed the arts, civic education, and cultural heritage for all - an experience that has shaped her in immeasurable ways.  With the support of her professional experiences, she firmly believes her education at Wheaton has undeniably fostered her unconditional love and curiosity for the arts. Currently, she is interning part-time at Galerie d'Orsay in Boston as a gallery assistant, where she works with clients and staff members who are just as passionate about Master and Modern visual productions as she is. After graduation, she hopes to continue working with and learning from professionals in the arts field, eventually pursuing a Master's degree.
