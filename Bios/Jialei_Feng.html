Jialei Feng will graduate from Wheaton College in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History. Her passion in Art History is like her creative mantras unleashing her curiosity and motivations to understand the evolution of the world. Originally from Shanghai, China, she was motivated to study abroad in the United States to explore the cultural diversity. During the fall semester of 2015, Jialei studied abroad at University College London, where she continued to cultivate her knowledge in the history of art. In the last two summers, Jialei interned at Shanghai Museum and a private gallery in M50 Art District in Shanghai as an assistant of the exhibition curator. Her experiences at these two different art fields allowed her to develop skills and abilities for varied needs in multiple working environments. After her graduation, Jialei is determined to pursue a Master's degree in Digital Marketing and continue to develop her professional skills in the hopes of sharing her love of art with more people.
