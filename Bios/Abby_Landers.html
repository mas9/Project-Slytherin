	Abby is an Art History major at Wheaton College graduating in 2018. Ever since her study abroad to Aix - en - Provence, France in high school her passion for art and art history began. During her time there she travelled to Paris, Prague and London visiting art galleries and famous art museums. Being an Art History major at Wheaton has expanded her knowledge of the art world by taking a variety of art history classes. Last summer she had the opportunity to intern at Phillips Auctioneers in New York City. While interning there she learned about what happens in the world of art. Her experiences living in a foreign country and interning at Phillips has sparked her interest even more to continue her passion for art. Hopefully, this summer she will be able to further her experience working in the art world!
