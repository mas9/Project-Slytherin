	Lucy Frey will be graduating in May of 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and Elementary Education. During Lucy's time at Wheaton she has been involved in many different parts of the campus community. She is part of the Women's Swimming and Diving Team, the Precepting Program, is a Wheaton Athletic Mentor, works as an assistant in the President's office, and volunteers in a 3rd grade classroom in the Norton Public School System. Lucy's favorite artists include John Singer Sargent, Ansel Adams, and Mario Testino. Although her favorite museum is the Victoria & Albert in London, she loves visiting museums wherever she travels. Lucy has developed her passion for art history and education by incorporating the two to fit her dream of becoming a 5th grade teacher. Her classroom will be a hub for creative thinking and encourage imagination and discovery. Although knowledge and facts are important building blocks, Lucy has learned throughout her time at Wheaton that curiosity is infectious and ultimately imagination is the synthesis of knowledge.
