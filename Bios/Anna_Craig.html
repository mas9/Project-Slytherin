   Anna Craig will graduate from Wheaton College in May 2017 with a degree in Art History. Although she is sad to be leaving this community, she feels her four years at Wheaton have prepared her for a lifetime of adventure and a meaningful career.  Anna counts her time abroad during her junior year as the highlight of her college career and two of the most influential experiences of her entire life. While in London for the fall semester of her junior year, Anna interned for the Association for Cultural Advancement through Visual Arts (ACAVA), an arts and education charity that works to provide artists with affordable studio space while encouraging community arts programming. Through this experience she discovered her passion for community-artist regeneration projects. Anna also studied in Bhutan as a member of the tenth Wheaton in Bhutan group where she conducted independent research on the emerging contemporary art movement in Bhutan. She also interned for the Voluntary Artist Studio Thimphu, an NGO and Civil Service Organization which is currently the only contemporary art space in the country. Back on American soil, Anna has dedicated herself to the political process both as an organizer for the New Hampshire Democratic Party during the 2016 election and as an intern for Congressman Joe Kennedy. During her time at Wheaton Anna has also involved herself with the Emerson Feminist Perspectives House, the Wheaton College Outdoors Club and the Center for Global Education.
